### Using Git

#### What is Git?

In a nutshell, Git provides a sophisticated version control system, allowing you to
track incremental changes to your projects and share and collaborate with others (via GitHub).

#### Getting started

Let's create a git repository. First navigate to a directory that you want to make a Git repository. Then run

```
git init
```

What's the status of the repository?

```
git status
```

Okay, let's make some changes.

Create a basic program, or move a program or file you already have into the repository.
Then check the status again!


```
git status
```

Now I want I want the repository to start tracking this file.

```
git add
```
